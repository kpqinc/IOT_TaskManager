The technology to implement wireless sensors to control heating/cooling zones for home application already exist. Most homes are not equipped with these systems. However, these homes may experience variations in comfort level during periods of extreme weather. Or there may be an area of the home where comfort could be improved in normal weather conditions by a few additional minutes of heating or cooling. These situations are generally remedied by manually increasing or lowering the thermostat setting.

This article describes the analysis of collected remote temperature sensor data, and the engineering of the software and hardware implemented for a remote temperature sensing application using the MQTT protocol. The data collected from the sensors was aggregated to a local MQTT gateway versus a cloud gateway during the initial prototyping.
